## Abstract
This study explores the application of association rule mining techniques to analyze sales data from Silver Linings, a local business in Hyderabad, India, dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the traditional art of filigree jewelry making. Over a span of seven years, the sales data were meticulously examined to identify patterns and relationships between various jewelry items, with the aim of generating actionable insights for product bundling and customer base expansion. Employing advanced algorithms such as FP-Growth, the research delves into transactional data to unveil hidden synergies among products. The analysis distinguishes between peak and normal sales seasons, reflecting the influence of cultural festivities and everyday consumer behavior on jewelry demand. The findings underscore the significant role of seasonal trends in shaping purchasing patterns, offering a strategic framework for Silver Linings to optimize their product offerings and enhance their market position.
